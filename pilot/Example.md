# Basic Flow / Thought process / Intro for session
We want to make a website?! OK thats awesome

What do we need?
* HTML: The language for presenting the content.
* CSS: The language for fancyfying the content. (#Desgin)
* Javascript,Jquery: Because we want to be a cool non-90s website.

Oh wait ... but where will this run?
So we also need:
* Computer: To host & serve our content.
(A server, running ubuntu, cause ccis)
* Program: To send our content to people who want to see it!
(Apache, this is called a 'webserver')

But to set these things up we need...
To log in to the server...
* ssh

And then to install the program we need
* root
* bash
* Package managers

But since we're being nice we'll paper over some of the heavy Systems
Administration stuff so they can learn some basics of installing stuff
as they go along.
