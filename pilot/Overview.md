# Overview

This is a set of sessions dedicated to helping students gain the software skills they
need in order to go from 0 to 'thing'!
Many students come to college with an interest in making something cool. Then
they meet someone who's already made something cool, and then they feel like
they can never make something as cool as that, because there is 'So much to
learn'.

That's where learnathons come in! We're here to help you learn the things you
need to go from 0 to project in minutes rather than spending hours wondering how
to install apache on Arch.

# General Session Structure
## Teaching
In each session there will be time dedicated to teaching the new software and
tools that participants will be using.

## Making
The after getting a moderate dose of theory and explanation of how to use the
technologies presented in the 'Learning' section participants will be handed
some parts to start off with, and get to apply what they have learned.

## Showing Off
Everyone loves presenting what they've made! For each session we'll then show
off what we've built, and talk about how to build _real_ apps with the skill's
we've covered in the session.
